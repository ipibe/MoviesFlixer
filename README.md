## CSc 690 - Final Project Idea
   For the final project I decided I wanted to show a list of of movies currently playing in theater. The way
   this would work is by getting the API from the website "The MovieDB" at https://www.themoviedb.org
   This website will get the current Movies playing on theaters and my goal is to be able and show these movies
   aswell as be able to show a brief description of what the movie is about. Since the website has to refresh constantly
   my app will automatically will refresh as well and give you the top trending movies.
